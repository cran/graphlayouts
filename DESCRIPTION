Description: Several new layout algorithms to visualize networks are provided which are not part of 'igraph'. 
    Most are based on the concept of stress majorization by Gansner et al. (2004) <doi:10.1007/978-3-540-31843-9_25>. 
    Some more specific algorithms allow the user to emphasize hidden group structures in networks or focus on specific nodes.
